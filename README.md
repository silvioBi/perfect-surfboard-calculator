## TODOs

[ ] add an explanation for all the fields like skill level, fitness level, etc
[ ] put the demo on r/surfing
[ ] add a brief intro to the surfboards results explaining why do you show
those surfboards
[ ] rethink the wave range input, it would make sense to let the user
choose a location and calculate the average wave height
